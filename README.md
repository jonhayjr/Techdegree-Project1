Treehouse - Frontend Techdegree - Project 1
My Personal Profile Page
________________________________________________
With this project, I needed to personalize the existing HTML and CSS for a Profile Page with my own content.  I updated the background and profile images, updated the placeholder text with my own text, and added a new Experience page.  Since I wanted to go for an 'Exceeds Expectations' grade, I also added a Contact page, updated some of the CSS properties on my profile image, added additional text content and updated the HTML to make it more semantic.
